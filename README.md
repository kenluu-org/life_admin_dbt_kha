# TickTick dbt Project

This dbt project is designed for transforming data sourced from the TickTick official Open API. It currently supports two primary data streams: `projects` and `tasks`.

## Data Ingestion

Data is ingested into the data warehouse using a purpose-built Airbyte connector for TickTick. You can find more details about the connector here: [https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources/ticktick](https://docs.airbyte.com/integrations/sources/ticktick).

Airbyte loads the raw data into the data warehouse, which then serves as the source for dbt transformations.

## Data Transformation with dbt Snapshots

This project leverages dbt snapshots to capture historical changes in the `projects` and `tasks` data. Snapshots are run on a schedule to capture missing attributes and infer key timestamps:

*   **`created_time`**: Inferred as the minimum `dbt_valid_from` timestamp from the snapshot metadata.
*   **`done_time`**: Inferred as the `dbt_valid_to` date for hard-deleted records in the snapshot.

## Configuration: GTD "Shallow vs. Deep Work" Feature

This guide explains how to set up the "Shallow vs. Deep Work" categorization feature.

### The "Why": Business Use Case

The primary goal of this feature is to provide a visual distinction between "shallow work" and "deep work." This allows you to quickly assess the nature of your completed tasks and strive for a healthy balance between quick, reactive tasks (Shallow Work `ðŸ§ƒ`) and more substantial, planned work (Deep Work `ðŸ¥©`).

This aligns with the GTD (Getting Things Done) workflow, where tasks are either completed immediately (shallow) or go through a formal clarification process before being executed (deep).

### How to Configure

#### 1. Create a `.env` File

If you don't already have one, create a `.env` file in the root of your dbt project. This file will store the environment variables that dbt will use to configure the feature.

#### 2. Define the Environment Variables

Add the following variables to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Enable or disable the GTD feature
ENABLE_GTD_WORK_TYPE_CATEGORIZATION=true

# Define the tags for deep work (as a JSON array)
GTD_DEEP_WORK_TAGS='["clarified"]'

# Define the tags for shallow work (as a JSON array)
GTD_SHALLOW_WORK_TAGS='[""]'
```

#### Variable Explanations:

*   **`ENABLE_GTD_WORK_TYPE_CATEGORIZATION`**: Set this to `true` to enable the feature. If it's set to `false` or not defined, the `gtd_work_type` column will not be populated.
*   **`GTD_DEEP_WORK_TAGS`**: This is a JSON-formatted array of strings. Any task that has one of these tags will be categorized as "Deep Work" (`ðŸ¥©`).
*   **`GTD_SHALLOW_WORK_TAGS`**: This is also a JSON-formatted array of strings. Any task with one of these tags will be categorized as "Shallow Work" (`ðŸ§ƒ`). If a task has no tags, it will also be considered "Shallow Work".

### 3. How It Works

The `dbt_project.yml` file is configured to read these environment variables and use them to control the logic in the `stg_tasks` model. If the environment variables are not set, dbt will use the default values defined in `dbt_project.yml`.

By using a `.env` file, you can easily customize the feature for your specific workflow without modifying the core dbt code, making this project easily adaptable.

## Getting Started

1.  **Set up your Airbyte connection**: Configure the TickTick Airbyte connector to load data into your data warehouse.
2.  **Configure dbt profiles**: Ensure your `profiles.yml` is correctly set up to connect to your data warehouse.
3.  **Run dbt commands**:
    *   To run snapshots: `dbtf snapshot`
    *   To build models: `dbt build`

## Notes on Previous Iteration

This project is an evolution of a previous effort, which can be found at [https://github.com/luutuankiet/ticktick-py-dbt](https://github.com/luutuankiet/ticktick-py-dbt). The key distinction in this iteration is the direct utilization of the TickTick official Open API for data extraction.
